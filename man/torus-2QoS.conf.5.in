.SH NAME
torus\-2QoS.conf \- Torus-2QoS configuration for OpenSM subnet manager
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The file
.B torus-2QoS.conf
contains configuration information that is specific to the OpenSM
routing engine torus-2QoS.
Blank lines and lines where the first non-whitespace character is
"#" are ignored.
A token is any contiguous group of non-whitespace characters.
Any tokens on a line following the recognized configuration tokens described
below are ignored.

.RS
Either \fBtorus\fR or \fBmesh\fR must be the first keyword in the
configuration, and sets the topology
that torus-2QoS will try to construct.
A 2D topology can be configured by specifying one of
\fIx_radix\fR, \fIy_radix\fR, or \fIz_radix\fR as 1.
An individual dimension can be configured as mesh (open) or torus
(looped) by suffixing its radix specification with one of
\fBm\fR, \fBM\fR, \fBt\fR, or \fBT\fR.  Thus, "mesh 3T 4 5" and
"torus 3 4M 5M" both specify the same topology.
.P
Note that although torus-2QoS can route mesh fabrics, its ability to
route around failed components is severely compromised on such fabrics.
A failed fabric component is very likely to cause a disjoint ring;
see \fBUNICAST ROUTING\fR in torus-2QoS(8).

These keywords are used to seed the torus/mesh topology.
For example, "xp_link 0x2000 0x2001" specifies that a link from
the switch with node GUID 0x2000 to the switch with node GUID 0x2001
would point in the positive x direction,
while "xm_link 0x2000 0x2001" specifies that a link from
the switch with node GUID 0x2000 to the switch with node GUID 0x2001
would point in the negative x direction.  All the link keywords for
a given seed must specify the same "from" switch.
.P
In general, it is not necessary to configure both the positive and
negative directions for a given coordinate; either is sufficient.
However, the algorithm used for topology discovery needs extra information
for torus dimensions of radix four (see \fBTOPOLOGY DISCOVERY\fR in
torus-2QoS(8)).  For such cases both the positive and negative coordinate
directions must be specified.
.P
Based on the topology specified via the \fBtorus\fR/\fBmesh\fR keyword,
torus-2QoS will detect and log when it has insufficient seed configuration.

\fBz_dateline

\fR
.RS
In order for torus-2QoS to provide the guarantee that path SL values
do not change under any conditions for which it can still route the fabric,
its idea of dateline position must not change relative to physical switch
locations.  The dateline keywords provide the means to configure such
behavior.
.P
The dateline for a torus dimension is always between the switch with
coordinate 0 and the switch with coordinate radix-1 for that dimension.
By default, the common switch in a torus seed is taken as the origin of
the coordinate system used to describe switch location.
The \fIposition\fR parameter for a dateline keyword moves the origin
(and hence the dateline) the specified amount relative to the common
switch in a torus seed.
.RE
.
.P
\fBnext_seed
\fR
.RS
If any of the switches used to specify a seed were to fail torus-2QoS
would be unable to complete topology discovery successfully.
The \fBnext_seed\fR keyword specifies that the following link and dateline
keywords apply to a new seed specification.
.P
For maximum resiliency, no seed specification should share a switch
with any other seed specification.
Multiple seed specifications should use dateline configuration to
ensure that torus-2QoS can grant path SL values that are constant,
regardless of which seed was used to initiate topology discovery.
.RE

.P
\fBportgroup_max_ports
\fImax_ports
\fR
.RS
This keyword specifies the maximum number of parallel inter-switch
links, and also the maximum number of host ports per switch, that
torus-2QoS can accommodate.
The default value is 16.
Torus-2QoS will log an error message during topology discovery if this
parameter needs to be increased.
If this keyword appears multiple times, the last instance prevails.
.P
Note that the switch management port (switch port 0) gets put into
the same port group with the host ports, so if you have 16 host ports per
switch, portgroup_max_ports would need to be at least 17.
.RE
.
.P
\fBport_order
\fIp1 p2 p3 ...
\fR
.RS
This keyword specifies the order in which CA ports on a destination switch
are visited when computing routes. When the fabric contains switches connected
with multiple parallel links, routes are distributed in a round-robin fashion
across such links, and so changing the order that CA ports are visited changes
the distribution of routes across such links.  This may be advantageous for
some specific traffic patterns.
.P
The default is to visit CA ports in increasing port
order on destination switches.
.P
Duplicate values in the list will be ignored.

# z is not radix-4 torus dimension, only need one of

# If OpenSM failover is configured, for maximum resiliency
# one instance should run on a host attached to a switch
# from the first seed, and another instance should run
# on a host attached to a switch from the second seed.
# Both instances should use this torus-2QoS.conf to ensure
# path SL values do not change in the event of SM failover.

# port_order defines the order on which the ports would be
# chosen for routing.

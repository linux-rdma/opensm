Current OpenSM Routing
11/14/12

OpenSM offers nine routing engines:

1.  Min Hop Algorithm - based on the minimum hops to each node where the
path length is optimized.

2.  UPDN Unicast routing algorithm - also based on the minimum hops to each
node, but it is constrained to ranking rules. This algorithm should be chosen
if the subnet is not a pure Fat Tree, and deadlock may occur due to a
loop in the subnet.

3. DNUP Unicast routing algorithm - similar to UPDN but allows routing in
fabrics which have some CA nodes attached closer to the roots than some switch
nodes.

4.  Fat-tree Unicast routing algorithm - this algorithm optimizes routing
of fat-trees for congestion-free "shift" communication pattern.
It should be chosen if a subnet is a symmetrical fat-tree.
Similar to UPDN routing, Fat-tree routing is credit-loop-free.

5. LASH unicast routing algorithm - uses Infiniband virtual layers
(SL) to provide deadlock-free shortest-path routing while also
distributing the paths between layers. LASH is an alternative
deadlock-free topology-agnostic routing algorithm to the non-minimal
UPDN algorithm avoiding the use of a potentially congested root node.

6. DOR Unicast routing algorithm - based on the Min Hop algorithm, but
avoids port equalization except for redundant links between the same
two switches.  This provides deadlock free routes for hypercubes when
the fabric is cabled as a hypercube and for meshes when cabled as a
mesh (see details below).

7. Torus-2QoS unicast routing algorithm - a DOR-based routing algorithm
specialized for 2D/3D torus topologies.  Torus-2QoS provides deadlock-free
routing while supporting two quality of service (QoS) levels.  In addition
it is able to route around multiple failed fabric links or a single failed
fabric switch without introducing deadlocks, and without changing path SL
values granted before the failure.

8. DFSSSP unicast routing algorithm - a deadlock-free single-source-
shortest-path routing, which uses the SSSP algorithm (see algorithm 9.)
as the base to optimize link utilization and uses Infiniband virtual lanes
(SL) to provide deadlock-freedom.

9. SSSP unicast routing algorithm - a single-source-shortest-path routing
algorithm, which globally balances the number of routes per link to
optimize link utilization. This routing algorithm has no restrictions
in terms of the underlying topology.

OpenSM provides an optional unicast routing cache (enabled by -A or
--ucast_cache options). When enabled, unicast routing cache prevents
routing recalculation (which is a heavy task in a large cluster) when
there was no topology change detected during the heavy sweep, or when
the topology change does not require new routing calculation, e.g. when
one or more CAs/RTRs/leaf switches going down, or one or more of these
nodes coming back after being down.
A very common case that is handled by the unicast routing cache is host
reboot, which otherwise would cause two full routing recalculations: one
when the host goes down, and the other when the host comes back online.

OpenSM also supports a file method which can load routes from a table. See
modular-routing.txt for more information on this.

The basic routing algorithm is comprised of two stages:
1. MinHop matrix calculation
   How many hops are required to get from each port to each LID ?
   The algorithm to fill these tables is different if you run standard
(min hop) or Up/Down.
   For standard routing, a "relaxation" algorithm is used to propagate
min hop from every destination LID through neighbor switches
   For Up/Down routing, a BFS from every target is used. The BFS tracks link
direction (up or down) and avoid steps that will perform up after a down
step was used.

2. Once MinHop matrices exist, each switch is visited and for each target LID,
a decision is made as to what port should be used to get to that LID.
   This step is common to standard and Up/Down routing. Each port has a
counter counting the number of target LIDs going through it.
   When there are multiple alternative ports with same MinHop to a LID,
the one with less previously assigned LIDs is selected.
   If LMC > 0, more checks are added: Within each group of LIDs assigned to
same target port,
   a. use only ports which have same MinHop
   b. first prefer the ones that go to different systemImageGuid (then
the previous LID of the same LMC group)
   c. if none - prefer those which go through another NodeGuid
   d. fall back to the number of paths method (if all go to same node).


Effect of Topology Changes

OpenSM will preserve existing routing in any case where there is no change in
the fabric switches unless the -r (--reassign_lids) option is specified.

-r
--reassign_lids
          This option causes OpenSM to reassign LIDs to all
          end nodes. Specifying -r on a running subnet
          may disrupt subnet traffic.
          Without -r, OpenSM attempts to preserve existing
          LID assignments resolving multiple use of same LID.

If a link is added or removed, OpenSM does not recalculate
the routes that do not have to change. A route has to change
if the port is no longer UP or no longer the MinHop. When routing changes
are performed, the same algorithm for balancing the routes is invoked.

In the case of using the file based routing, any topology changes are
currently ignored The 'file' routing engine just loads the LFTs from the file
specified, with no reaction to real topology. Obviously, this will not be able
to recheck LIDs (by GUID) for disconnected nodes, and LFTs for non-existent
switches will be skipped. Multicast is not affected by 'file' routing engine
(this uses min hop tables).


Min Hop Algorithm
-----------------

The Min Hop algorithm is invoked by default if no routing algorithm is
specified.  It can also be invoked by specifying '-R minhop'.

The Min Hop algorithm is divided into two stages: computation of
min-hop tables on every switch and LFT output port assignment. Link
subscription is also equalized with the ability to override based on
port GUID. The latter is supplied by:

-i <equalize-ignore-guids-file>
--ignore_guids <equalize-ignore-guids-file>
          This option provides the means to define a set of ports
          (by guids) that will be ignored by the link load
          equalization algorithm.

LMC awareness routes based on (remote) system or switch basis.


UPDN Routing Algorithm
----------------------

Purpose of UPDN Algorithm

The UPDN algorithm is designed to prevent deadlocks from occurring in loops
of the subnet. A loop-deadlock is a situation in which it is no longer
possible to send data between any two hosts connected through the loop. As
such, the UPDN routing algorithm should be used if the subnet is not a pure
Fat Tree, and one of its loops may experience a deadlock (due, for example,
to high pressure).

The UPDN algorithm is based on the following main stages:

1.  Auto-detect root nodes - based on the CA hop length from any switch in
the subnet, a statistical histogram is built for each switch (hop num vs
number of occurrences). If the histogram reflects a specific column (higher
than others) for a certain node, then it is marked as a root node. Since
the algorithm is statistical, it may not find any root nodes. The list of
the root nodes found by this auto-detect stage is used by the ranking
process stage.

    Note 1: The user can override the node list manually.
    Note 2: If this stage cannot find any root nodes, and the user did not
            specify a guid list file, OpenSM defaults back to the Min Hop
            routing algorithm.

2.  Ranking process - All root switch nodes (found in stage 1) are assigned
a rank of 0. Using the BFS algorithm, the rest of the switch nodes in the
subnet are ranked incrementally. This ranking aids in the process of enforcing
rules that ensure loop-free paths.

3.  Min Hop Table setting - after ranking is done, a BFS algorithm is run from
each (CA or switch) node in the subnet. During the BFS process, the FDB table
of each switch node traversed by BFS is updated, in reference to the starting
node, based on the ranking rules and guid values.

At the end of the process, the updated FDB tables ensure loop-free paths
through the subnet.

Note: Up/Down routing does not allow LID routing communication between
switches that are located inside spine "switch systems".
The reason is that there is no way to allow a LID route between them
that does not break the Up/Down rule.
One ramification of this is that you cannot run SM on switches other
than the leaf switches of the fabric.


UPDN Algorithm Usage

Activation through OpenSM

Use '-R updn' option (instead of old '-u') to activate the UPDN algorithm.
Use `-a <guid_list_file>' for adding an UPDN guid file that contains the
root nodes for ranking.
If the `-a' option is not used, OpenSM uses its auto-detect root nodes
algorithm.

Notes on the guid list file:
1.   A valid guid file specifies one guid in each line. Lines with an invalid
format will be discarded.
2.   The user should specify the root switch guids. However, it is also
possible to specify CA guids; OpenSM will use the guid of the switch (if
it exists) that connects the CA to the subnet as a root node.


To learn more about deadlock-free routing, see the article
"Deadlock Free Message Routing in Multiprocessor Interconnection Networks"
by William J Dally and Charles L Seitz (1985).


DNUP Routing Algorithm
----------------------

Purpose:

The DNUP algorithm is designed to serve a similar purpose to UPDN. However
it is intended to work in network topologies which are unsuited to
UPDN due to nodes being connected closer to the roots than some of
the switches.  An example would be a fabric which contains nodes and
uplinks connected to the same switch. The operation of DNUP is the
same as UPDN with the exception of the ranking process.  In DNUP all
switch nodes are ranked based solely on their distance from CA Nodes,
all switch nodes directly connected to at least one CA are assigned a
value of 1 all other switch nodes are assigned a value of one more than
the minimum rank of all neighbor switch nodes.


Fat-tree Routing Algorithm
--------------------------

Purpose:

The fat-tree algorithm optimizes routing for "shift" communication pattern.
It should be chosen if a subnet is a symmetrical or almost symmetrical
fat-tree of various types.
It supports not just K-ary-N-Trees, by handling for non-constant K,
cases where not all leafs (CAs) are present, any Constant
Bisectional Ratio (CBB) ratio.  As in UPDN, fat-tree also prevents
credit-loop-deadlocks.

If the root guid file is not provided ('-a' or '--root_guid_file' options),
the topology has to be pure fat-tree that complies with the following rules:
  - Tree rank should be between two and eight (inclusively)
  - Switches of the same rank should have the same number
    of UP-going port groups*, unless they are root switches,
    in which case the shouldn't have UP-going ports at all.
  - Switches of the same rank should have the same number
    of DOWN-going port groups, unless they are leaf switches.
  - Switches of the same rank should have the same number
    of ports in each UP-going port group.
  - Switches of the same rank should have the same number
    of ports in each DOWN-going port group.
  - All the CAs have to be at the same tree level (rank).

If the root guid file is provided, the topology doesn't have to be pure
fat-tree, and it should only comply with the following rules:
  - Tree rank should be between two and eight (inclusively)
  - All the Compute Nodes** have to be at the same tree level (rank).
    Note that non-compute node CAs are allowed here to be at different
    tree ranks.

* ports that are connected to the same remote switch are referenced as
'port group'.
** list of compute nodes (CNs) can be specified by '-u' or '--cn_guid_file'
OpenSM options.

Note that although fat-tree algorithm supports trees with non-integer CBB
ratio, the routing will not be as balanced as in case of integer CBB ratio.
In addition to this, although the algorithm allows leaf switches to have any
number of CAs, the closer the tree is to be fully populated, the more effective
the "shift" communication pattern will be.
In general, even if the root list is provided, the closer the topology to a
pure and symmetrical fat-tree, the more optimal the routing will be.

The algorithm also dumps compute node ordering file (opensm-ftree-ca-order.dump)
in the same directory where the OpenSM log resides. This ordering file provides
the CN order that may be used to create efficient communication pattern, that
will match the routing tables.

Routing between non-CN nodes


The use of the cn_guid_file option allows non-CN nodes to be located on different levels in the fat tree.
In such case, it is not guaranteed that the Fat Tree algorithm will route between two non-CN nodes.
In the scheme below, N1, N2 and N3 are non-CN nodes. Although all the CN have routes to and from them,
there will not necessarily be a route between N1,N2 and N3.
Such routes would require to use at least one of the Switch the wrong way around
(In fact, go out of one of the top Switch through a downgoing port while we are supposed to go up).

  Spine1   Spine2    Spine 3
   / \     /  |  \    /   \
  /   \   /   |   \  /     \
 N1  Switch   N2  Switch    N3
      /|\          /|\
     / | \        / | \
    Going down to compute nodes

To solve this problem, a list of non-CN nodes can be specified by \'-G\' or \'--io_guid_file\' option.
Theses nodes will be allowed to use switches the wrong way around a specific number of times (specified by \'-H\' or \'--max_reverse_hops\'.
With the proper max_reverse_hops and io_guid_file values, you can ensure full connectivity in the Fat Tree.

In the scheme above, with a max_reverse_hop of 1, routes will be instanciated between N1<->N2 and N2<->N3.
With a max_reverse_hops value of 2, N1,N2 and N3 will all have routes between them.

Please note that using max_reverse_hops creates routes that use the switch in a counter-stream way.
This option should never be used to connect nodes with high bandwidth traffic between them ! It should only be used
to allow connectivity for HA purposes or similar.
Also having routes the other way around can in theory cause credit loops.

Use these options with extreme care !


Usage:

Activation through OpenSM

Use '-R ftree' option to activate the fat-tree algorithm.

Note: LMC > 0 is not supported by fat-tree routing. If this is
specified, the default routing algorithm is invoked instead.


LASH Routing Algorithm
----------------------

LASH is an acronym for LAyered SHortest Path Routing. It is a
deterministic shortest path routing algorithm that enables topology
agnostic deadlock-free routing within communication networks.

When computing the routing function, LASH analyzes the network
topology for the shortest-path routes between all pairs of sources /
destinations and groups these paths into virtual layers in such a way
as to avoid deadlock.

Note LASH analyzes routes and ensures deadlock freedom between switch
pairs. The link from HCA between and switch does not need virtual
layers as deadlock will not arise between switch and HCA.

In more detail, the algorithm works as follows:

1) LASH determines the shortest-path between all pairs of source /
destination switches. Note, LASH ensures the same SL is used for all
SRC/DST - DST/SRC pairs and there is no guarantee that the return
path for a given DST/SRC will be the reverse of the route SRC/DST.

2) LASH then begins an SL assignment process where a route is assigned
to a layer (SL) if the addition of that route does not cause deadlock
within that layer. This is achieved by maintaining and analysing a
channel dependency graph for each layer. Once the potential addition
of a path could lead to deadlock, LASH opens a new layer and continues
the process.

3) Once this stage has been completed, it is highly likely that the
first layers processed will contain more paths than the latter ones.
To better balance the use of layers, LASH moves paths from one layer
to another so that the number of paths in each layer averages out.

Note, the implementation of LASH in opensm attempts to use as few layers
as possible. This number can be less than the number of actual layers
available.

In general LASH is a very flexible algorithm. It can, for example,
reduce to Dimension Order Routing in certain topologies, it is topology
agnostic and fares well in the face of faults.

It has been shown that for both regular and irregular topologies, LASH
outperforms Up/Down. The reason for this is that LASH distributes the
traffic more evenly through a network, avoiding the bottleneck issues
related to a root node and always routes shortest-path.

The algorithm was developed by Simula Research Laboratory.

To learn more about LASH and the flexibility behind it, the requirement
for layers, performance comparisons to other algorithms, see the
following articles:

Networks", Skeie et al. IEEE Computer Society Communication
Architecture for Clusters 2002.


Use '-R lash -Q ' option to activate the LASH algorithm.

Note: QoS support has to be turned on in order that SL/VL mappings are
used.

Note: LMC > 0 is not supported by the LASH routing. If this is
specified, the default routing algorithm is invoked instead.

For open regular cartesian meshes the DOR algorithm is the ideal
routing algorithm. For toroidal meshes on the other hand there
are routing loops that can cause deadlocks. LASH can be used to
route these cases. The performance of LASH can be improved by
preconditioning the mesh in cases where there are multiple links
connecting switches and also in cases where the switches are not
cabled consistently. An option exists for LASH to do this. To
invoke this use '-R lash -Q --do_mesh_analysis'. This will
add an additional phase that analyses the mesh to try to determine
the dimension and size of a mesh. If it determines that the mesh
looks like an open or closed cartesian mesh it reorders the ports
in dimension order before the rest of the LASH algorithm runs.

DOR Routing Algorithm
---------------------

The Dimension Order Routing algorithm is based on the Min Hop
algorithm and so uses shortest paths.  Instead of spreading traffic
out across different paths with the same shortest distance, it chooses
among the available shortest paths based on an ordering of dimensions.
Each port must be consistently cabled to represent a hypercube
dimension or a mesh dimension.  Paths are grown from a destination
back to a source using the lowest dimension (port) of available paths
at each step.  This provides the ordering necessary to avoid deadlock.
When there are multiple links between any two switches, they still
represent only one dimension and traffic is balanced across them
unless port equalization is turned off.  In the case of hypercubes,
the same port must be used throughout the fabric to represent the
hypercube dimension and match on both ends of the cable.  In the case
of meshes, the dimension should consistently use the same pair of
ports, one port on one end of the cable, and the other port on the
other end, continuing along the mesh dimension.

Use '-R dor' option to activate the DOR algorithm.

Torus-2QoS Routing Algorithm
----------------------------

Torus-2QoS is a routing algorithm designed for large-scale 2D/3D torus fabrics.
The torus-2QoS routing engine can provide the following functionality on
a 2D/3D torus:
- routing that is free of credit loops
- two levels of QoS, assuming switches support 8 data VLs
- ability to route around a single failed switch, and/or multiple failed
    links, without
    - introducing credit loops
    - changing path SL values
- very short run times, with good scaling properties as fabric size
    increases

Unicast Routing:

Torus-2QoS is a DOR-based algorithm that avoids deadlocks that would otherwise
occur in a torus using the concept of a dateline for each torus dimension.
It encodes into a path SL which datelines the path crosses as follows:

  sl = 0;
  for (d = 0; d < torus_dimensions; d++)
    /* path_crosses_dateline(d) returns 0 or 1 */
    sl |= path_crosses_dateline(d) << d;

For a 3D torus, that leaves one SL bit free, which torus-2QoS uses to
implement two QoS levels.

Torus-2QoS also makes use of the output port dependence of switch SL2VL
maps to encode into one VL bit the information encoded in three SL bits.
It computes in which torus coordinate direction each inter-switch link
"points", and writes SL2VL maps for such ports as follows:

  for (sl = 0; sl < 16; sl ++)
    /* cdir(port) reports which torus coordinate direction a switch port
     * "points" in, and returns 0, 1, or 2 */
    sl2vl(iport,oport,sl) = 0x1 & (sl >> cdir(oport));

Thus, on a pristine 3D torus, i.e., in the absence of failed fabric switches,
torus-2QoS consumes 8 SL values (SL bits 0-2) and 2 VL values (VL bit 0)
per QoS level to provide deadlock-free routing on a 3D torus.

Torus-2QoS routes around link failure by "taking the long way around" any
1D ring interrupted by a link failure.  For example, consider the 2D 6x5
torus below, where switches are denoted by [+a-zA-Z]:

	|    |    |    |    |    |
   4  --+----+----+----+----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   3  --+----+----+----D----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   2  --+----+----I----r----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   1  --m----S----n----T----o----p--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
 y=0  --+----+----+----+----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |

      x=0    1    2    3    4    5

For a pristine fabric the path from S to D would be S-n-T-r-D.  In the
event that either link S-n or n-T has failed, torus-2QoS would use the path
S-m-p-o-T-r-D.  Note that it can do this without changing the path SL
value; once the 1D ring m-S-n-T-o-p-m has been broken by failure, path
segments using it cannot contribute to deadlock, and the x-direction
dateline (between, say, x=5 and x=0) can be ignored for path segments on
that ring.

One result of this is that torus-2QoS can route around many simultaneous
link failures, as long as no 1D ring is broken into disjoint segments.  For
example, if links n-T and T-o have both failed, that ring has been broken
into two disjoint segments, T and o-p-m-S-n.  Torus-2QoS checks for such
issues, reports if they are found, and refuses to route such fabrics.

Note that in the case where there are multiple parallel links between a pair
of switches, torus-2QoS will allocate routes across such links in a round-
robin fashion, based on ports at the path destination switch that are active
and not used for inter-switch links.  Should a link that is one of several
such parallel links fail, routes are redistributed across the remaining
links.   When the last of such a set of parallel links fails, traffic is
rerouted as described above.

Handling a failed switch under DOR requires introducing into a path at
least one turn that would be otherwise "illegal", i.e. not allowed by DOR
rules.  Torus-2QoS will introduce such a turn as close as possible to the
failed switch in order to route around it.

In the above example, suppose switch T has failed, and consider the path
from S to D.  Torus-2QoS will produce the path S-n-I-r-D, rather than the
S-n-T-r-D path for a pristine torus, by introducing an early turn at n.
Normal DOR rules will cause traffic arriving at switch I to be forwarded
to switch r; for traffic arriving from I due to the "early" turn at n,
this will generate an "illegal" turn at I.

Torus-2QoS will also use the input port dependence of SL2VL maps to set VL
bit 1 (which would be otherwise unused) for y-x, z-x, and z-y turns, i.e.,
those turns that are illegal under DOR.  This causes the first hop after
any such turn to use a separate set of VL values, and prevents deadlock in
the presence of a single failed switch.

For any given path, only the hops after a turn that is illegal under DOR
can contribute to a credit loop that leads to deadlock.  So in the example
above with failed switch T, the location of the illegal turn at I in the
path from S to D requires that any credit loop caused by that turn must
encircle the failed switch at T.  Thus the second and later hops after the
illegal turn at I (i.e., hop r-D) cannot contribute to a credit loop
because they cannot be used to construct a loop encircling T.  The hop I-r
uses a separate VL, so it cannot contribute to a credit loop encircling T.

Extending this argument shows that in addition to being capable of routing
around a single switch failure without introducing deadlock, torus-2QoS can
also route around multiple failed switches on the condition they are
adjacent in the last dimension routed by DOR.  For example, consider the
following case on a 6x6 2D torus:


	|    |    |    |    |    |
   5  --+----+----+----+----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   4  --+----+----+----D----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   3  --+----+----I----u----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   2  --+----+----q----R----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   1  --m----S----n----T----o----p--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
 y=0  --+----+----+----+----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |

      x=0    1    2    3    4    5


Suppose switches T and R have failed, and consider the path from S to D.
Torus-2QoS will generate the path S-n-q-I-u-D, with an illegal turn at
switch I, and with hop I-u using a VL with bit 1 set.

As a further example, consider a case that torus-2QoS cannot route without
deadlock: two failed switches adjacent in a dimension that is not the last
dimension routed by DOR; here the failed switches are O and T:

	|    |    |    |    |    |
   5  --+----+----+----+----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   4  --+----+----+----+----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   3  --+----+----+----+----D----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   2  --+----+----I----q----r----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   1  --m----S----n----O----T----p--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
 y=0  --+----+----+----+----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |

      x=0    1    2    3    4    5

In a pristine fabric, torus-2QoS would generate the path from S to D as
S-n-O-T-r-D.  With failed switches O and T, torus-2QoS will generate the
path S-n-I-q-r-D, with illegal turn at switch I, and with hop I-q using a
VL with bit 1 set.  In contrast to the earlier examples, the second hop
after the illegal turn, q-r, can be used to construct a credit loop
encircling the failed switches.

Multicast Routing:

Since torus-2QoS uses all four available SL bits, and the three data VL
bits that are typically available in current switches, there is no way
to use SL/VL values to separate multicast traffic from unicast traffic.
Thus, torus-2QoS must generate multicast routing such that credit loops
cannot arise from a combination of multicast and unicast path segments.

It turns out that it is possible to construct spanning trees for multicast
routing that have that property.  For the 2D 6x5 torus example above, here
is the full-fabric spanning tree that torus-2QoS will construct, where "x"
is the root switch and each "+" is a non-root switch:

   4    +    +    +    +    +    +
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   3    +    +    +    +    +    +
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   2    +----+----+----x----+----+
	|    |    |    |    |    |

For multicast traffic routed from root to tip, every turn in the above
spanning tree is a legal DOR turn.

For traffic routed from tip to root, and some traffic routed through the
root, turns are not legal DOR turns.  However, to construct a credit loop,
the union of multicast routing on this spanning tree with DOR unicast
routing can only provide 3 of the 4 turns needed for the loop.

In addition, if none of the above spanning tree branches crosses a dateline
used for unicast credit loop avoidance on a torus, and if multicast traffic
is confined to SL 0 or SL 8 (recall that torus-2QoS uses SL bit 3 to
differentiate QoS level), then multicast traffic also cannot contribute to
the "ring" credit loops that are otherwise possible in a torus.

Torus-2QoS uses these ideas to create a master spanning tree.  Every
multicast group spanning tree will be constructed as a subset of the master
tree, with the same root as the master tree.

Such multicast group spanning trees will in general not be optimal for
groups which are a subset of the full fabric. However, this compromise must
be made to enable support for two QoS levels on a torus while preventing
credit loops.

In the presence of link or switch failures that result in a fabric for
which torus-2QoS can generate credit-loop-free unicast routes, it is also
possible to generate a master spanning tree for multicast that retains the
required properties.  For example, consider that same 2D 6x5 torus, with
the link from (2,2) to (3,2) failed.  Torus-2QoS will generate the following
master spanning tree:

   4    +    +    +    +    +    +
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   3    +    +    +    +    +    +
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   2  --+----+----+    x----+----+--
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   1    +    +    +    +    +    +
	|    |    |    |    |    |
 y=0    +    +    +    +    +    +

      x=0    1    2    3    4    5

Two things are notable about this master spanning tree.  First, assuming
the x dateline was between x=5 and x=0, this spanning tree has a branch
that crosses the dateline.  However, just as for unicast, crossing a
dateline on a 1D ring (here, the ring for y=2) that is broken by a failure
cannot contribute to a torus credit loop.

Second, this spanning tree is no longer optimal even for multicast groups
that encompass the entire fabric.  That, unfortunately, is a compromise that
must be made to retain the other desirable properties of torus-2QoS routing.

In the event that a single switch fails, torus-2QoS will generate a master
spanning tree that has no "extra" turns by appropriately selecting a root
switch.  In the 2D 6x5 torus example, assume now that the switch at (3,2),
i.e. the root for a pristine fabric, fails.  Torus-2QoS will generate the
following master spanning tree for that case:

		       |
   4    +    +    +    +    +    +
	|    |    |    |    |    |
   3    +    +    +    +    +    +
	|    |    |         |    |
   2    +    +    +         +    +
	|    |    |         |    |
   1    +----+----x----+----+----+
	|    |    |    |    |    |
 y=0    +    +    +    +    +    +
		       |

      x=0    1    2    3    4    5

Assuming the y dateline was between y=4 and y=0, this spanning tree has
a branch that crosses a dateline.  However, again this cannot contribute
to credit loops as it occurs on a 1D ring (the ring for x=3) that is
broken by a failure, as in the above example.

Torus Topology Discovery:

The algorithm used by torus-2QoS to construct the torus topology from the
undirected graph representing the fabric requires that the radix of each
dimension be configured via torus-2QoS.conf. It also requires that the
torus topology be "seeded"; for a 3D torus this requires configuring four
switches that define the three coordinate directions of the torus.

Given this starting information, the algorithm is to examine the cube
formed by the eight switch locations bounded by the corners (x,y,z) and
(x+1,y+1,z+1).  Based on switches already placed into the torus topology at
some of these locations, the algorithm examines 4-loops of interswitch
links to find the one that is consistent with a face of the cube of switch
locations, and adds its swiches to the discovered topology in the correct
locations.

Because the algorithm is based on examining the topology of 4-loops of links,
a torus with one or more radix-4 dimensions requires extra initial seed
configuration.  See torus-2QoS.conf(5) for details. Torus-2QoS will detect
and report when it has insufficient configuration for a torus with radix-4
dimensions.

In the event the torus is significantly degraded, i.e., there are many
missing switches or links, it may happen that torus-2QoS is unable to place
into the torus some switches and/or links that were discovered in the
fabric, and will generate a warning in that case.  A similar condition
occurs if torus-2QoS is misconfigured, i.e., the radix of a torus dimension
as configured does not match the radix of that torus dimension as wired,
and many switches/links in the fabric will not be placed into the torus.

Quality Of Service Configuration:

OpenSM will not program switchs and channel adapters with SL2VL maps or VL
arbitration configuration unless it is invoked with -Q.  Since torus-2QoS
depends on such functionality for correct operation, always invoke OpenSM
with -Q when torus-2QoS is in the list of routing engines.

Any quality of service configuration method supported by OpenSM will work
with torus-2QoS, subject to the following limitations and considerations.

For all routing engines supported by OpenSM except torus-2QoS, there is a
one-to-one correspondence between QoS level and SL. Torus-2QoS can only
support two quality of service levels, so only the high-order bit of any SL
value used for unicast QoS configuration will be honored by torus-2QoS.

For multicast QoS configuration, only SL values 0 and 8 should be used with
torus-2QoS.

Since SL to VL map configuration must be under the complete control of
torus-2QoS, any configuration via qos_sl2vl, qos_swe_sl2vl, etc., must and
will be ignored, and a warning will be generated.

For inter-switch links, Torus-2QoS uses VL values 0-3 to implement one of
its supported QoS levels, and VL values 4-7 to implement the other. For
endport links (CA, router, switch management port), Torus-2QoS uses VL
value 0 for one of its supported QoS levels and VL value 1 to implement
the other.  Hard-to-diagnose application issues may arise if traffic is
not delivered fairly across each of these two VL ranges. For
inter-switch links, Torus-2QoS will detect and warn if VL arbitration is
configured unfairly across VLs in the range 0-3, and also in the range
4-7. Note that the default OpenSM VL arbitration configuration does
not meet this constraint, so all torus-2QoS users should configure VL
arbitration via qos_ca_vlarb_high, qos_swe_vlarb_high, qos_ca_vlarb_low,
qos_swe_vlarb_low, etc.

Note that torus-2QoS maps SL values to VL values differently
for inter-switch and endport links.  This is why qos_vlarb_high and
qos_vlarb_low should not be used, as using them may result in
VL arbitration for a QoS level being different across inter-switch
links vs. across endport links.

Operational Considerations:

Any routing algorithm for a torus IB fabric must employ path SL values to
avoid credit loops. As a result, all applications run over such fabrics
must perform a path record query to obtain the correct path SL for
connection setup. Applications that use rdma_cm for connection setup will
automatically meet this requirement.

If a change in fabric topology causes changes in path SL values required to
route without credit loops, in general all applications would need to
repath to avoid message deadlock. Since torus-2QoS has the ability to
reroute after a single switch failure without changing path SL values,
repathing by running applications is not required when the fabric is routed
with torus-2QoS.

Torus-2QoS can provide unchanging path SL values in the presence of subnet
manager failover provided that all OpenSM instances have the same idea of
dateline location. See torus-2QoS.conf(5) for details.

Torus-2QoS will detect configurations of failed switches and links that
prevent routing that is free of credit loops, and will log warnings and
refuse to route. If "no_fallback" was configured in the list of OpenSM
routing engines, then no other routing engine will attempt to route the
fabric. In that case all paths that do not transit the failed components
will continue to work, and the subset of paths that are still operational
will continue to remain free of credit loops. OpenSM will continue to
attempt to route the fabric after every sweep interval, and after any
change (such as a link up) in the fabric topology. When the fabric
components are repaired, full functionality will be restored.

In the event OpenSM was configured to allow some other engine to route the
fabric if torus-2QoS fails, then credit loops and message deadlock are
likely if torus-2QoS had previously routed the fabric successfully. Even if
the other engine is capable of routing a torus without credit loops,
applications that built connections with path SL values granted under
torus-2QoS will likely experience message deadlock under routing generated
by a different engine, unless they repath.

To verify that a torus fabric is routed free of credit loops, use ibdmchk
to analyze data collected via ibdiagnet -vlr.

DFSSSP and SSSP Routing Algorithm
---------------------------------

The (Deadlock-Free) Single-Source-Shortest-Path routing algorithm is
designed to optimize link utilization thru global balancing of routes,
while supporting arbitrary topologies. The DFSSSP routing algorithm
uses Infiniband virtual lanes (SL) to provide deadlock-freedom.

The DFSSSP algorithm consists of five major steps:
1) It discovers the subnet and models the subnet as a directed
   multigraph in which each node represents a node of the physical
   network and each edge represents one direction of the full-duplex
   links used to connect the nodes.
2) A loop, which iterates over all CA and switches of the subnet, will
   perform three steps to generate the linear forwarding tables for
   each switch:
2.1) use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from all nodes
     to the current selected destination;
2.2) update the edge weights in the graph, i.e. add the number of
     routes, which use a link to reach the destination, to the link/edge;
2.3) update the LFT of each switch with the outgoing port which was used
     in the current step to route the traffic to the destination node.
3) After the number of available virtual lanes or layers in the subnet
   is detected and a channel dependency graph is initialized for each layer,
   the algorithm will put each possible route of the subnet into the first
   layer.
4) A loop iterates over all channel dependency graphs (CDG) and performs
   the following substeps:
4.1) search for a cycle in the current CDG;
4.2) when a cycle is found, i.e. a possible deadlock is present,
     one edge is selected and all routes, which induced this edge, are moved
     to the "next higher" virtual layer (CDG[i+1]);
4.3) the cycle search is continued until all cycles are broken and
     routes are moved "up".
5) When the number of needed layers does not exceeds the number of
   available SL/VL to remove all cycles in all CDGs, the rounting is
   deadlock-free and an relation table is generated, which contains
   the assignment of routes from source to destination to a SL

Note on SSSP:
This algorithm does not perform the steps 3)-5) and can not be
considered to be deadlock-free for all topologies. But on the one
hand, you can choose this algorithm for really large networks
(5,000+ CAs and deadlock-free by design) to reduce
the runtime of the algorithm. On the other hand, you might use
the SSSP routing algorithm as an alternative, when all deadlock-free
routing algorithms fail to route the network for whatever reason.
In the last case, SSSP was designed to deliver an equal or higher
bandwidth due to better congestion avoidance than the Min Hop
routing algorithm.

Notes for usage:
  a) running DFSSSP: '-R dfsssp -Q'
    a.1) QoS has to be configured to equally spread the load on the
         available SL or virtual lanes
    a.2) applications must perform a path record query to get path SL for
         each route, which the application will use to transmite packages
  b) running SSSP:   '-R sssp'
  c) both algorithms support LMC > 0

Hints for separate optimization of compute and I/O traffic:
Having more nodes (I/O and compute) connected to a switch than incoming links
can result in a 'bad' routing of the I/O traffic as long as (DF)SSSP routing
is not aware of the dedicated I/O nodes, i.e., in the following network
configuration CN1-CN3 might send all I/O traffic via Link2 to IO1,IO2:

     CN1         Link1        IO1
        \       /----\       /
  CN2 -- Switch1      Switch2 -- CN4
        /       \----/       \
     CN3         Link2        IO2

To prevent this from happening (DF)SSSP can use both the compute node guid
file and the I/O guid file specified by the '-u' or '--cn_guid_file' and
'-G' or '--io_guid_file' options (similar to the Fat-Tree routing).
This ensures that traffic towards compute nodes and I/O nodes is balanced
separately and therefore distributed as much as possible across the available
links. Port GUIDs, as listed by ibstat, must be specified (not Node GUIDs).
The priority for the optimization is as follows:
  compute nodes -> I/O nodes -> other nodes
Possible use case szenarios:
  a) neither '-u' nor '-G' are specified: all nodes a treated as 'other nodes'
     and therefore balanced equally;
  b) '-G' is specified: traffic towards I/O nodes will be balanced optimally;
  c) the system has three node types, such as login/admin, compute and I/O,
     but the balancing focus should be I/O, then one has to use '-u' and '-G'
     with I/O guids listed in cn_guid_file and compute node guids listed in
     io_guid_file;
  d) ...

OpenSM Partition configuration
===============================

The default name of OpenSM partitions configuration file is
'$(OPENSM_CONFIG_DIR)/partitions.conf' (where $(OPENSM_CONFIG_DIR) is set at
configure time and defaults to ${sysconfdir}/opensm). The default may be
changed at run time by using the --Pconfig (-P) option with OpenSM.

The default partition will be created by OpenSM unconditionally even
when partition configuration file does not exist or cannot be accessed.

The default partition has P_Key value 0x7fff. OpenSM's port will always
have full membership in default partition. All other end ports will have
full membership if the partition configuration file is not found or cannot
be accessed, or limited membership if the file exists and can be accessed
but there is no rule for the Default partition.

Effectively, this amounts to the same as if one of the following rules
below appear in the partition configuration file:
In the case of no rule for the Default partition:
Default=0x7fff : ALL=limited, SELF=full ;
In the case of no partition configuration file or file cannot be accessed:
Default=0x7fff : ALL=full ;

General file format:

<Partition Definition>:[<newline>]<Partition Properties>;

     Partition Definition:
       [PartitionName][=PKey][,indx0][,ipoib_bc_flags][,defmember=full|limited|both]

        PartitionName  - string, will be used with logging. When
                         omitted, empty string will be used.
        PKey           - P_Key value for this partition. Only low 15
                         bits will be used. When omitted will be
                         autogenerated.
	indx0          - indicates that this pkey should be inserted in
			 block 0 index 0.
        ipoib_bc_flags - used to indicate/specify IPoIB capability of
                         this partition.

        defmember=full|limited|both - specifies default membership for
                         port guid list. Default is limited.

     ipoib_bc_flags:
        ipoib_flag|[mgroup_flag]*

        ipoib_flag:
		ipoib  - indicates that this partition may be used for
                         IPoIB, as a result the IPoIB broadcast group will
                         be created with the mgroup_flag flags given,
                         if any.

     Partition Properties:
       [<Port list>|<MCast Group>]* | <Port list>

     Port list:
        <Port Specifier>[,<Port Specifier>]

     Port Specifier:
        <PortGUID>[=[full|limited|both]]

        PortGUID         - GUID of partition member EndPort.
                           Hexadecimal numbers should start from
                           0x, decimal numbers are accepted too.
        full or          - indicates full and/or limited membership for
        limited or         this port.  When omitted (or unrecognized)
        both               limited membership is assumed.  Both
                           indicates both full and limited membership
                           for this port.

     MCast Group:
        mgid=gid[,mgroup_flag]*<newline>

                    - gid specified is verified to be a Multicast
                      address.  IP groups are verified to match
                      the rate and mtu of the broadcast group.
                      The P_Key bits of the mgid for IP groups are
                      verified to either match the P_Key specified
                      in by "Partition Definition" or if they are
                      0x0000 the P_Key will be copied into those
                      bits.

     mgroup_flag:
        rate=<val>  - specifies rate selector for this MC group
                      | Selector |  Gb/s  |         |

                      | 24       | 1200   |         |

        mtu=<val>   - specifies MTU selector for this MC group
                      | Selector |  MTU   |         |
                      |----------|--------|---------|
                      | 1        |  256   |         |

                      | 5        | 4096   |         |

        sl=<val>    - specifies SL for this MC group
                      (default is 0)
        scope=<val> - specifies scope for this MC group
                      (default is 2 (link local)).  Multiple scope
                      settings are permitted for a partition.
                      NOTE: This overwrites the scope nibble of the
                            specified mgid.  Furthermore specifying
                            multiple scope settings will result in
                            multiple MC groups being created.
        Q_Key=<val>     - specifies the Q_Key for this MC group
                          (default: 0x0b1b for IP groups, 0 for other
                           groups)
                          WARNING: changing this for the broadcast
                                   group may break IPoIB on client
                                   nodes!!!
        TClass=<val>    - specifies tclass for this MC group
                          (default is 0)
        FlowLabel=<val> - specifies FlowLabel for this MC group
                          (default is 0)
	NOTE: All mgroup_flag flags MUST be separated by comma (,).

Note that values for rate, mtu, and scope, for both partitions and multicast
groups, should be specified as defined in the IBTA specification (for example,
mtu=5 for 4096).

There are several useful keywords for PortGUID definition:

 - 'ALL' means all end ports in this subnet.
 - 'ALL_CAS' means all Channel Adapter end ports in this subnet.
 - 'ALL_SWITCHES' means all Switch end ports in this subnet.
 - 'ALL_ROUTERS' means all Router end ports in this subnet.
 - 'SELF' means subnet manager's port.

Empty list means no ports in this partition.



Notes:
-----

White space is permitted between delimiters ('=', ',',':',';').

PartitionName does not need to be unique, PKey does need to be unique.
If PKey is repeated then those partition configurations will be merged
and first PartitionName will be used (see also next note).

It is possible to split partition configuration in more than one
definition, but then PKey should be explicitly specified (otherwise
different PKey values will be generated for those definitions).



Examples:
--------

 Default=0x7fff : ALL, SELF=full ;
 Default=0x7fff : ALL, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full ;

 NewPartition , ipoib : 0x123456=full, 0x3456789034=limi, 0x2134af2306 ;

 YetAnotherOne = 0x300 : SELF=full ;
 YetAnotherOne = 0x300 : ALL=limited ;

 ShareIO = 0x80 , defmember=full : 0x123451, 0x123452;
 # 0x123453, 0x123454 will be limited
 ShareIO = 0x80 : 0x123453, 0x123454, 0x123455=full;
 # 0x123456, 0x123457 will be limited
 ShareIO = 0x80 , defmember=limited : 0x123456, 0x123457, 0x123458=full;
 ShareIO = 0x80 , defmember=full : 0x123459, 0x12345a;
 ShareIO = 0x80 , defmember=full : 0x12345b, 0x12345c=limited, 0x12345d;

 # multicast groups added to default
 Default=0x7fff,ipoib:
        mgid=ff12:401b::0707,sl=1 # random IPv4 group
        mgid=ff12:601b::16    # MLDv2-capable routers
        mgid=ff12:401b::16    # IGMP
        mgid=ff12:601b::2     # All routers
        mgid=ff12::1,sl=1,Q_Key=0xDEADBEEF,rate=3,mtu=2 # random group
        ALL=full;


Note:
----

The following rule is equivalent to how OpenSM used to run prior to the
partition manager:

Default=0x7fff,ipoib:ALL=full;
